# SolNinja SDK (Coming Soon)
A TypeScript SDK for integrating shielded transactions and privacy-preserving transfers on Solana using SolNinja’s confidential pool. It will provide simple APIs for depositing, transferring, proving, and selectively revealing transaction metadata—abstracting cryptography and low-level runtime details.

Planned highlights:

High-level client for shielded pool interactions
Local proof generation + lightweight verifier helpers
Deterministic commitment/nullifier utilities
Optional audit / selective disclosure flows
Example recipes (private transfer, batched exits)
Star the repo to get notified when the first preview drops.
